Here is some sample code for a Discord bot in Python that randomly says fun facts from an API every 15 minutes:

To use this code, you will need to replace CHANNEL_ID with the ID of the Discord channel where you want the bot to post the fun facts, and replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your bot's token.

You will also need to install the discord and requests Python packages. You can do this by running pip install discord requests in your terminal or command prompt.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
